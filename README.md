Welcome! This is an open source self-driving development platform aimed for rapid prototyping, deep learning, and robotics research. The system currently runs on a modified electric cart. Here are our goals:

Goals:
Research and develop a deep learning-driven self-driving car.

The modules in this project.
End-to-End Steering (Behavioral cloning)
Semantic Segmentation
Object Detection blue_car
Drive by Wire (DBW)
CARLA simulator integration
ZED stereoscopic vision system
Mapping with rtabamp
Path planning with ROS nav stack.
Localization, pose tracking, and odom with ZED and rtabmap.
